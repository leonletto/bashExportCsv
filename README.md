# bashExportCsv
Bash function to export flattened csv files from curl responses or other similar json.
Works for large responses and flattens the output.



## Testing
I have a test script which will test various scenarios
I like to add my logging module, but it can be omitted

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/leonletto/bashLogger.git submodules/bashLogger


```
